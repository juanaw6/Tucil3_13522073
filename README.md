## Features

The key features of this program include:

- **Uniform Cost Search:** This algorithm finds the shortest path from the initial word to the final word by considering the cost of each step equally.
- **Greedy Best First Search:** This algorithm prioritizes paths that seem to be closest to the goal state based on a heuristic function without considering the cost of each step.
- **A* Search:** This algorithm combines the advantages of both Uniform Cost Search and Greedy Best First Search by considering both the cost of each step and a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal state.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Java is Installed:** Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install Java JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/id/java/technologies/downloads/).

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/juanaw6/Tucil3_13522073.git
   ```

3. **Auto-Compile and Run the App:**

- If you are using Windows:

  ```
  ./run.bat
  ```

- If you are using Linux or macOS:

  ```
  ./run.sh
  ```

4. **Compile the Program Manually:**

- If you are using Windows:

  ```
  ./compile.bat
